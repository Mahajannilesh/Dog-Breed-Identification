Project Overview:
Our project is about identifying breeds of dog from its image. The model accepts an image of dog  and identify its corresponding breed.Our dataset containing almost 120 different breeds of dog.

We have implemented this model using Convolutional Neural Network. 
As CNN works in layer format so it takes time to train model
so for improving accuracy of our model we have used Resnet-50 with technique called transfer learning. 
We have got nearly 83 percent accuracy for our model.
